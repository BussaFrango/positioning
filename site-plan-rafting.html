                    • Biosecurity is a set of prophylactic measures capable of
                    maintaining the healthy integrity of chicks.
                    • The term used to describe the general strategy or set of measures

                <h4>There is a case of the existence of living organisms inside the
                    poultry, which can cause
                    the
                    existence of these bacteria. for example, if we treat a stump with a
                    certain medication,
                    there will come a time when the birds will catch that stump that
                    even giving that
                    medication, the cure will have no effect on the birds because the
                    bacteria have already
                    become very strong in relation to itself healing, which is why it is
                    always good to
                    respect
                    this issue for the sake of this cause. However, we also have to
                    observe the distribution
                    of
                    the chicks during the first seven days in what has to do with
                    aspects such as:
                    Temperature,
                    because the same chicks are the ones that dictate the case of the
                    environment inside the
                    aviary. However, this implies that the same chicks must demonstrate
                    actions such as
                    drinking, playing running from one side to the other occupying the
                    entire extinct of the
                    aviary, thus it will be proof positive that the environment in which
                    they will be will
                    be
                    good.
                    If we see that they are forming groups, agglomerating in quantities
                    occupying the
                    corners of
                    the walls, this is to imply that the temperature inside the aviary
                    is very low or has
                    high
                    temperatures.
                    And this is the only way the birds have that makes us have a
                    perception, and if there is
                    the
                    case of the same birds being very close to the heat or rather, to
                    the lamps, this
                    implies
                    that the environment of the aviary is very cold because soon, the
                    birds run to the heat
                    source, and if the same action that the same birds show when they
                    run to the heat
                    source,
                    after a while we can notice that they don't eat or water well, which
                    means that we will
                    have
                    a delay in the growth of the birds. same.
                    And if by chance we have chicks with a lower weight, in the first
                    few days, as soon as
                    they
                    go without food, they will not be able to modify their own organism,
                    which will bring a
                    high
                    mortality rate. Why do these two things always go together.
                    That's why it's always good to make these little observations. Give
                    yourself as much
                    time as
                    possible to perfectly monitor the temperature so that the birds are
                    not at ease.</h4>

                <h5>Is a case that if we are negligent with the birds in the sense of not
                    taking care of them
                    in a
                    correct way, they will not gain stimulus to grow and in the end, they
                    will be so lazy.
                    However, if the equipment happens to be a little low, they will access
                    the food, but if it
                    is
                    too low in the sense of the proper eaters, they will not be adjusted.
                    The following can happen, if the equipment is too low, they will take
                    time to grow because
                    they
                    will eat sitting down and if it is too high, they will not eat and the
                    will weaken their
                    organism, they will be very weak and easily and any disease can attack
                    them.
                    The best thing that will help us to understand if our birds are being
                    taken care of in the
                    correct way, is doing the weekly weighings because if we can't determi
                    the development of
                    the
                    birds by eye, the best thing is to start doing the weekly weighing
                    according to the weights
                    of
                    the expected standards because until the seventh day, birds are expect
                    to weigh between
                    140g
                    and 170g.
                    However, during this period, the weighing is carried out in the
                    perspective that they are at
                    that weight and so we can determine that the birds are even at the
                    standard weight. And from
                    there, we'll check that everything we've been doing since the beginnin
                    with the preparation
                    of
                    the aviaries, and the equipment itself, is right and if it's at the
                    right time. However, if
                    we
                    notice a balance in their weight and growth, we should.</h5>
